# Pivoting-Tunneling-Port-Forwarding

This repository is part of my YouTube playlist (“[URL](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdjivcdVUZLbLVPYfJdsbf4KOV852Vzb3)”) that covers the core concepts of Pivoting, Tunneling, and Port Forwarding as used in CTFs, offensive security certifications, and real-world lab environments.

All tools and techniques demonstrated here are intended strictly for educational purposes. The author does not encourage or support the use of these methods for any illegal or unethical activity.

These techniques should only be practiced in authorized environments such as labs, CTFs, or approved security research. Use at your own risk.
